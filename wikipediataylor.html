                <h1>Early Life</h1>
                <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. 
                    A subject of widespread public interest with a vast fanbase, she has influenced the music industry, 
                    popular culture and politics through her songwriting, artistry, entrepreneurship, and advocacy.</p>
            </article>
            <h1>Career beginnings and first album</h1>
                <p>In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, 
                    Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers and formed a lasting 
                    working relationship with Liz Rose.They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions 
                    every Tuesday afternoon after school.[34] Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest
                    I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in 
                    school that day. She had such a clear 
                    vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.
                    " Swift became the youngest artist 
                    signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left then BMG-owned RCA Records 
                    (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 
                    14 due to the label's lack of care and them "cutting other people's stuff". 
                    She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. 
                    I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.</p>
